    "Rat": [
      "Make no mistake about it, this animal can only be master or slave. He can be master of the art of trickery and of prudence, instigator of plots, puller of strings behind the political scene or a great militarist and emperor of strategy. That is unless, from his earliest childhood, this Rat/Rat turns out to be a frentic individualist, rejecting dogmas and principles, constraints and proprieties, perpetually on the hunt for food and lodging with the aggressiveness to be expected of such a rodent.",
      "In his other aspect, as a slave, he will be in a state of permanent conflict with himself, having chosen the servitude of the 'domestic rat', which, despite its apparent advantages, will always be at war with his instinctive need to be independent and self-supporting. As a slave, he has to renounce his desire to bewitch and fascinate others. This Rat/Rat will not frighten anyone but himself."
    ],
    "Ox": ["Here the Companion is a striking example of a pseudo guardian angel. The aggressions of the Rat are tempered by the tranquil force of the Ox. The Rat explores in depth, the Ox on the surface. Both being creators, it is the Ox who sometimes, by butting with his horns, will force the Rat to leave his underground passages, jostling him from his fortifications. A love of liberty, the Buffalo will rarely be sidetracked. If the Rat symbolizes perpetual movement, the other symbolizes slowness; and if Ox dreams of virgin territory, the Rat dreams of impenetrable universes. The Rat/Ox will be realistic, prudent and will know how to reinforce his success."],
    "Tiger": ["When a rodent is coupled with a carnivorous animal, the voyage will not be very peaceful; count on the Tiger, he will see to it that you do not fall asleep on your laurels! The hunt is his domain, the jungle his universe; the way will be strewn with traps and nothing will escape his vigilance. As a sentinel, he is unsurpassed. However, do not forget that the Tiger is a noble lord, who will expect to be first. In roaming various territories, he will appropriate them, and the individualistic Rat nature will respond with a violent revolt, which may result in your being emotionally torn. Do not despair. The Tiger is also a symbol of moderation. He is an excellent guide, in every sense of the term, and the Rat, at times a usurper himself, will gain in tolerance and loyalty."],
    "Rabbit": ["This is a curious mixture, to say the least. Are you not these hereditary enemies 'condemned' to travel the same route? But do not be fooled, for this may be the best way to accomplish the voyage. An apprehensive Rat coupled with the eternally stalking Rabbit will not be easily deceived. Suspicious, both adaptable and aggressive, he will be ready to protect himself from predators and to go to any lengths to secure his comfort and vested interests. Also, the influence of the Rabbit will make the Rat less vulnerable to outbursts of passion. Calm and efficient, the Rat/Rabbit illustrates the aphorism 'Better to risk an intelligent friend than indulge a stupid one.'"],
    "Dragon": [
      "This is a lucky combination, for the Dragon is an excellent companion for the Rat. The voyage will be magical. In deepest harmony with himself, the Rat will leave his bottomless depths and will ride his scaled companion across the Milky Way, his muzzle in the stars. But be careful! If you allow yourself to be spellbound by the Dragon within you, you will pay dearly for it. You idolize him; he is fond of you. He reassures you; but in the end makes your decisions for you. The Dragon is prone to terrible rages; you will hide away. You must know how to make the most of your luck. Imagine it as a voyage in the watery depths and through the heavens, which also embraces the terrestrial world and its deeper recesses. Only do not forget that sometimes you must fight the Dragon in order to prevail, and that he is a ferocious sentinel.",
      "Here is a Companion strong enough for the Rat, master of forces from below."
    ],
    "Snake": [
      "These two are brothers, but they fight each other mercilessly. Their territory is identical, but they have won it with bites and scratches, venom and trickery. The Rat and Snake are masters of the art of attack; moreover they are intuitive, professional spellbinders, who run the risk of putting each other to sleep by using mutual hypnosis. Alas, in this situation, the Rat cannot reverse roles.",
      "The Snake will not lend himself to this little game. For the Rat the Snake Companion will always remain a mysterious reptile, coiled up under a stone, waiting to drag him at times into perilous labyrinths."
    ],
    "Horse": [
      "This coupling brings about an interchange between ardour and prudence. The Rat/Horse will go on often tumultuous voyages. What battles lie in wait! It will be difficult to temper the ardour of the Horse galloping under the blazing sun, while the anxious and prudent Rat will be busy securing his underground fortresses.",
      "The ill-loved Rat must take dark and twisting paths to reach the light, while, for the Horse, it is intolerable to gallop in the shade. He needs the luminous Royal Way, and seeks the crowd and worldly success. The poor Rat must, however, straddle this charger and accept him as his guide. Lacking the power to bridle the magician, the Rat can always discover the joys of riding."
    ],
    "Goat": [
      "Here is an excellent Companion for the Rat, very different from him, whose nature is lighthearted and free from care. An intuitive and subtle artist, the Goat will be prodigiously therapeutic for our ill-loved and anxious rodent. Moreover, the Goat responds to charm and appreciates sympathetic magic, and will not be bored by these qualities in the Rat.",
      "Both will have a tendency to float about in a world of illusions, but, since they will get something worthwhile out of it, it is no matter if they seem blind and deaf; for these two it can be a useful technique."
    ],
    "Monkey": ["Before leaving a trip, these two should prepare a first aid kit; their journey is more likely to resemble a hazardous undertaking than an agreeable outing. These two companions believe in the principle of 'an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth' and repay each other accordingly. The Monkey will have but one idea: to devour the small rodent. The Rat will use all his tricks, including the most perverse, to make his companion fall into physical, moral and even spiritual traps. These two strange companions will have no tenderness for each other and will give each other no respite. Their journey will become an encounter staged in a prize-fighter's ring, where all blows are allowed and no rules are observe. May the more formidable win!"],
    "Rooster": ["The Rooster, announcing the rising of the sun, and the Rat, busy with his nocturnal activities, are two companions who will hardly have time for sleep. For these two dissimilar characters, a true understanding may seem impossible, yet it is precisely in this that they may prove to be complementary to each other. The Rooster will perch; the Rat will burrow. Each has a lively nature. The one is a sun symbol, the other a symbol of the night. They will mutually strengthen each other. Rat will offer his world of the underground on a gold platter to the Rooster at the very moment when the Rooster, ruffling his feathers, is rising on his spurs awaiting the moment of dawn's song. This is a daily offering on which the Rat would do well to meditate. For Master Rat, so often taking but rarely giving, this generous Rooster will be a source of strength, if he knows how to take what is offered."],
    "Dog": [
      "He can be the ideal Companion for the Rat. The Dog is the guide for souls during their 'voyages' and is the guardian of the beyond. Like the rodent, he moves between subterranean and invisible worlds. He is, moreover, a faithful and mysterious Companion, slightly pessimistic for, symbolically, he is often associated with the idea of death. Since the Rat shares this association, the Dog's presence is not always welcome.",
      "Perhaps one day the Rat will try to kill the Dog within him and, in battling against this guardian of the gates, he will break through his constraints. The Companion is sometimes a victim who must be sacrificed during the voyage."
    ],
    "Pig": [
      "On the one hand, the Pig is eager to cultivate the art of solitude. He will avoid the main routes, preferring bushy paths with their odour of humus and a quiet night lying under the stars. On the other hand, a Rat/Pig is a complete materialist. Hoarder and profiteer, he will know how to capitalize not only on money, but on the fruits of his experiences.",
      "The Rat/Pig will know only white or black; for him there are no shades of grey, no half-measures. His route will be scattered with obstructions which he will ruthlessly overcome. Do not count on him to have scuples; he will not know the meaning of the word.",
      "Be careful! The Pig is credulous and this, added to the curiosity of the Rat, will spring a few traps. So, Rat/Pig, before you set forth, lay in your provisions of cheese and acorns."

  "Ox": {
    "Rat": ["Here the Companion is a striking example of a pseudo guardian angel. The aggressions of the Rat are tempered by the tranquil force of the Ox. The Rat explores in depth, the Ox on the surface. Both being creators, it is the Ox who sometimes, by butting with his horns, will force the Rat to leave his underground passages, jostling him from his fortifications. A love of liberty, the Buffalo will rarely be sidetracked. If the Rat symbolizes perpetual movement, the other symbolizes slowness; and if Ox dreams of virgin territory, the Rat dreams of impenetrable universes. The Rat/Ox will be realistic, prudent and will know how to reinforce his success."],
    "Ox": ["Often a recluse and habitually drawn to isolation and retreat, the Ox is barely able to support his own company. A lover of liberty, always on the search for new lands and virgin soil, the Ox/Ox will be fiercely individualistic and original. He will often disconcert his companions, to whom he will be as sparing of tact as of understanding. Such an unwillingness to compromise borders on sheer egotism. The Ox/Ox belongs to the race of conquerors: nothing can constrain nor attach him."],
    "Tiger": ["Born under this alliance, seduction will be your major art. You are hardly likely to lose your way or fall asleep on the march. Conqueror of virgin lands and lord of the jungle, it will be extremely difficult to follow your track, for you are ferociously independent. Imagine a hunter joined to a dreamer, combining intelligence with muscular suppleness. But, Royal Tiger or not, you are also the symbol of temperance. Along with the tenacity and equilibrium of the age-old Ox, you bear within you a potential for sovereign and indomitable power. Alas, modesty and tenderness are not your strong points."],
    "Rabbit": ["A home-loving conqueror! The route will be difficult: the Ox/Rabbit will oscillate between anger and silence, and will hesitate between leaving entirely and retiring into contemplation. If at times the Rabbit element is a sort of ball-and-chain on the Ox, this will have its uses. Knowing in certain situations how to inspire prudence, calm anger and unknot nerves, the Rabbit can soften the stubbornness in which the Ox becomes entangled and stifled. Meanwhile, Ox will teach his Companion that real space and liberty cannot be measured by surface area alone, such as the size of the Rabbit's burrow. Which will win out - prudence or stubbornness? Take care, Ox/Rabbit, you are in danger of going round the world without leaving your room."],
    "Dragon": ["A poisoned gift! A Dragon is always synonymous with luck, but, alas, there is a negative element, above all for a solitary and independent Ox. The Dragon is extremely intelligent but he is inclined to impose his own patterns of life on others. Always on the move, he will do his best to drag the Ox into spaces and dimensions which do not conform to his desires. He will be roused to a fury, which the Ox will oppose with stubborn silence: he is a provoker and able to set the Ox's teeth on edge, and he will have a tendency to goad him; the Dragon dreams of liberty, but it is not the same as his. The Ox/Dragon must therefore take upon himself these two powerful poles, these two disparate forces which inhabit him. Their pressures may be seriously perturbing. Particularly dynamic activity - military, sports or intellectual - may enable the Ox/Dragon to harmonize these contradictory energies."],
    "Snake": ["The Ox will often be disorientated by the aggressiveness of his Snake Companion, who can nurture a dormant capacity for violence in him. The peaceful Ox, his eyes fixed on the blue line of the horizon, will not understand the behaviour of the reptile - his attacks, his secret hiding places, his sinuous approach. He will too often be tempted to crush him with a hoof, and in consequence will suffer many internal conflicts. The slow Ox, however will be stimulated by this mysterious reptile who lures him to a fen and then shows him how he waits, hidden beneath a stone. Although his Snake Companion disconcerts him, the Ox will certainly learn that there are paths that he must sometimes avoid."],
    "Horse": ["Shifting from ardour to slow deliberation and back, these two Companions will not share the same concept of their path. The Ox, sure of himself and restrained, likes to take his time; his progress is slow and he is therefore unwilling to put up with the ardent spirit of the Horse, who goads him on, dreaming of honour and sunlit lands while the Ox ruminates on mapped-out paths. The conscientious Ox, desirous of solitude, grinds his teeth in annoyance when faced with the unmethodical and instinctive side of the Horse and his love of crowds and spectacles. Will the Horse's 'fire' heat the body and soul of this Ox, who is sometimes too 'buried' in his earth? If the Ox/Horse can agree on division of labours, he will undeniably hold winning cards. At work, to the seriousness, thoroughness and perseverance of the Ox will be added the passion and creativity of the Horse. On an emotional level, the ardour and vivacity of the Horse will soften the Ox's hard shell of doubt."],
    "Goat": ["A little note of capriciousness on the part of our Ox. The light-hearted and carefree Goat will be an excellent Companion. With him, the Ox will remove his blinkers and his deep furrows will be adorned with wild flowers and bouquets of brambles. Retaining a degree of gravity, the Ox/Goat will be capable of unexpected capers. The route will therefore be fascinating, provided that the Ox/Goat knows how to maintain a healthy balance between the real and the fantastic."],
    "Monkey": ["The Ox will not resist the Monkey's charm, nor his persuasive and sympathetic magic for very long. Some good advice: if you want peace, give him the illusion that he is stronger but remain attentive and sympathetic. This courageous animal is remarkably agile; physically and mentally he is a first-rate acrobat and gifted with a rare power of persuasion. Take care, for the Monkey is sometimes a sorcerer, capable of transforming all the power of the Ox into mere confetti and mirages."],
    "Rooster": ["The Rooster will add a little wine to his water, or more exactly, he will add a pinch of generosity to his egotism. The Rooster has a sense for sharing and for friendship; admittedly he can behave like a braggart, but then his very ardour and vivacity are so charming that one forgives him everything. From his bravado the Ox will gain a great deal. The morning song of the Rooster will relieve the Ox of a certain torpor and dullness. The ideal would be composed of the Rooster's sharpness on the surface and the Ox's ability in depth."],
    "Dog": ["Here is an amalgam that is a little special, for the pessimism of the Dog, added to the slowness and austerity of the Ox, may result in an exceptional and somewhat forbidding gravity. The Dog is the ancient guardian of the Underworld, the Ox of the Labyrinth: this combination of Cerberus and Minotaur will be a bit disquieting. Yet the Dog can bring to the Ox a perspective and power of introspection which he often lacks. The Ox, for his part, will alleviate the doubts, the existential qualms and the tortured questions of the Dog. The Ox/Dog will thus obtain both hope and lucidity; he will know himself a little better, which is the beginning of true wisdom."],
    "Pig": [
      "Both the Ox and the Pig are sometimes slightly egotistical recluses. One is the symbol of fertility, the other of abundance. Their voyage will have every chance of material comfort, but there will be complications. With the Ox in charge, you will face the everyday world with a severe and uncompromising appearance; this will conceal your real life of secret corners and cosy beaches - so enjoyable, luxurious and unconstrained, and made even more pleasurable by discreet weekends, private clubs and closed circles.",
      "If the Pig is in charge, then under the facade of a man who enjoys life to the fullest, will lie an indestructible solidity and an unsuspected tenacity which will often make you all the more formidable, especially in business. Some will think they can soften you up by various means; you will appear all smiles, but inside you will remain glacial."
