      "Characteristics of the Wood Rat": [
        "Wood is the coefficient for equilibrium for the Rat. Wood is of the morning, springtime, a temperate nature, a lover of harmony, beauty and elegance. As an Element of the Rat, who originates from the North and belongs to the winter solstice, Wood brings the mildness that characterizes its season and also its creative force. It is in the spring that nature is reborn, after germinating beneath the earth, symbol of the rodent. Wood, which stretches its branches towards the sky, towards harmony, while plunging its tentacular roots into the belly of Mother Earth, is by its nature, a factor of equilibrium for the Rat. But Wood is also a passionate Element, with a distressing habit of self-destruction. It is at once susceptible and excessive, but without losing its dignity. It will even supply 'Wood' for our Rat's saw-mill! For the latter does not hold back from his aggressive impulses, his outbursts of anger, interminable sulks and dangerous passions."
      ],
      Health: [
        "The organ of Wood is the liver; its flavour is acid. The Rat, over-anxious and given to fretfulness, ought to keep a particularly close eye on his liver and refrain from drinking too much."
      ],
      "The Wood Rat and others": [
        "The Rat is inclined to be carefree, and it is best that he adopt a relaxed style in all his encounters. Faced with a conventional situation, he must improvise and allow his imagination and his inventive and creative mind free rein. The Wood Rat could be a poet, a painter or even a farmer, thus uniting freedom and space, sky and earth and the wind, whose son he is."
      ],
      "Some advice for a Wood Rat": [
        "You are handsome and passionate, ready at times to transform the social structure. An advocate of liberty, perhaps? Politics, the stage, the arts await you. So leave your subterranean passages, leave your deep hole, and be carefree and relaxed."
      ],
      "The Year of the Wood Rat": [
        "The culminating point of a Wood Rat year will be springtime, the period of growth and prosperity. Leaving winter behind him, the Rat will move away from his Northern territory and travel East. His Yin aspect will tend towards the dynamism of the Yang. The Rat should profit from this season to brave new worlds and to create. Be supple in all senses of the term, know how to adapt yourself; this will be your winning card.",
        "Tendency of the year: A year for diplomacy and suppleness, favourable for international relations; a year also for expanding agricultural activities and for an increase in the family. But an egotistical attitude will bring about disasters and a pervasive climate of anarchy."

The Wood Ox will tend to be more passionate than the Ox on its own; he will be quick to anger - which can represent a danger - and he will have a compulsion to lose his way, a summons to self-destructiveness. He is also in danger of being oversensitive, but his dignified attitude will conceal this. However, the scales will be balanced in his favour due to his strong will and great sense of equilibrium; he will survive. His need for harmony will always win out."],
      Health: ["The organ of Wood is the liver; its flavour is acid. Be on your guard against outbreaks of anger, nervousness and narrow-mindedness. In the end these can cause your downfall."],
      "The Wood Ox and others": ["He will often be relaxed and calm. He will be creative and imaginative, and will by far prefer his liberty to a brilliant career. He will search for a quality of life rather than for success.

        "The culminating point for a Wood Ox year will be spring, a period of growth and prosperity. The Ox will set out from his winter habitat in the North and travel East. His Yin aspect will reach out towards the dynamism of the Yang. Springtime for an Ox is synonymous with birth, life and work. Therefore, no hesitations! Give of yourself fully during this season, so favourable for creation, but remember to be flexible and open, ready to listen and absorb every impression. In this year of renewal you can apply novel techniques and new methods. Open your eyes and prick up your ears because fortune favours you.",
        "Tendency of the year: Be flexible and diplomatic and profit from your good luck, but do not sink into egotism; share happiness and joy throughout the year. Deny your true spirit or thwart your good impulses and you may be faced with your world in ruins."

Wood brings a little gentleness to our Tiger, softening his aggresive nature and opening his pride to nuances. In the spring, the seed buried deep in the soil during the long winter blossoms, and nature is reborn. Wood symbolizes the breaking of dawn and this will incite the Tiger to leave his hiding place. Wood stretches its branches towards the heavens in the direction of harmony, but also plunges its roots deep into the earth. This double movement is a balancing factor for the Tiger. But Wood is equally the symbol of passion, violence and even destruction and self-destruction. The Wood Tiger is thus an ambivalent person. Beneath his peaceful exterior his spirit is stirred by excessive and explosive impulses. For this reason others will find his behaviour strange and often disconcertring."],

Alas, this is an illusion and a mask, behind which he skillfully hides a highly anxious nature. If he allows himself to be overcome by this anxiety he will head straight for failure. The Wood Tiger, however, will know how to improvise and give free rein to his fertile imagination; in this way creativity will win out over reasoning."],
      "Some advice for a Wood Tiger": ["You are passionate, engaging, at ease (at least on the surface) and a lover of liberty. The stage attracts you, the limelight awaits you, the crowd's eyes are fixed upon you. Allow your inspiration free rein."],
      "The Year of the Wood Tiger": ["The culminating point for a Wood Tiger year will be springtime, a period of growth and prosperity. The Tiger will become extremely dynamic due to the Yang force which he bears withing him; thus he will be more enterprising and more creative. Profit from this period to start some new enterprise or develop your artistic talents - Wood is by nature poetic. However, always retain your flexibility; in this way you will find it easy to adapt and gain a new lease on life. This is the period to do so because your opportunism will be remarkably well paid."]

He will rediscover the mildness of the fertile and creative mid-season, which will restore his equilibrium, release his inventive powers and reinforce his taste for the beautiful. He will be pushed out of his nest and discover the spectacle of dawn. This Element will develop in the Rabbit a sense of adventure, a passion for travel and a love of nature. But Wood is also a symbol of violence, even of destruction and self-destruction. Although he will not lose his dignity nor his reserve, the Wood Rabbit will be vulnerable to internal jolts and passionate love storms which will leave him giddy and bewildered. If your instinctive impulses are allowed to dominate you, they will blind you. Overcome your aggresiveness; do not allow yourself to be drowned by your emotions."],
      Health: ["The organ of Wood is the liver; its flavour is acid. The Wood Rabbit will often be anxious, anguished and tormented. He will tend to worry and fret. Do not bite your paws, and be careful not to overeat."],

His tendency to be self-destructive would be nourished and lead him to ruin. Faced with established rules, the Wood Rabbit opts for a supple attitude. He prefers to improvise and allow his imagination free rein, which encourages his creative spirit. The Wood Rabbit has poetic gifts and is attracted to the arts in general - unless he chooses horticulture or landscaping, which can please his sense of beauty and harmony while fulfilling his need for space and liberty."],
      "Some advice for a Wood Rabbit": ["You possess a good figure and are elegant, poetic and have an artistic soul. You do not appreciate restraints and obligations, so take responsibility for yourself and do not impose rigid restrictions on yourself or you will explode. Leave your anxiety in the cloakroom, polish your act as the aesthetic seducer and allow yourself to enjoy the applause."],

He will be alive with a new energy urging him to create, whose principal source of inspiration will be nature. It is a year of harmony and suppleness which he must make use of with art and mastery. In some cases, however, the tendency may be reversed: there are criminal acts and conspiracies in the air."]

The Dragon will discover that there are treasures other than those he guards so jealously.

Aware of his weaknesses, such as his anxiety and self-questioning, he will respond to his predicament with a relaxed attitude, preferring his imagination to run free rather than be constricted by the rigid structures of a society in which he feels asphyxiated. This is a just and reasonable attitude especially suiting the Snake, who prefers the circle to the square and the curve to the angle. With deliberate improvisation, the Snake will extricate himself marvellously from the most difficult situations; he will glide and sneak in and out and let the storm pass; then, when it is all over, he will reappear, tranquil and calm. Inventive and creative, he will be a painter, poet, musician, craftsman, or even a gardener, nurseryman or landscape architect - someone who combines beauty with space."],

Metal will cool the Snake's warm blood, tending to harden him and make him rigid at the cost of his suppleness and intuition. Imagine a Snake that is completely stiff - he would break in two. Moreover, he will be attracted to an inaccessible and pure ideal which will merely bind him in an even more dogmatic rigidity.

Loving work that is well-done, expecting and demanding perfection in his own work, he will be pitiless with others, particularly those whom he loves and respects. Clear-sighted and perhaps suffering from his own demands on himself, he is much too proud to recognize his faults and will continue unflaggingly on his way, afraid of letting his resolve be weakened."],

      "Some advice for a Water Snake": ["You have qualities which demand to be used, for the sake of others and for yourself; learn to discover them and put them into practice. Otherwise, they will turn against you, paralyse you and condemn you to be an eternal wanderer."],

        "The culminating point in a Water Snake year will be winter, a period of gestation. The Yin of Water will balance the Yang of the Snake.",
        "Profit from this year to restore your energies and regain your inner balance. You can be active, and successfully so, but avoid overwork and all excesses, which are so often followed by depression. Maintain your equilibrium and do not waste your energy, otherwise you will ruin everything by wanting to go too far too quickly."

        "The ardent and impulsive Horse will seek to conquer and dominate the Water Element, becoming the aquatic Horse of Indian legends. But he must surface on to this earth, a symbol of space and liberty and more suited to serve his insatiable need for action and movement. Water will not be an impediment to the Horse; his dynamism and Yang tendency will always drive him into the depths of himself and those universes which, for him, are synonyms of conquest. The effect of the ardent energy of the Horse on Water is so frenzied that it can even make it come to a boil, a phenomenon from which derives the expression 'Fire Horse', to designate the Water Horse."
      ],
      Health: ["The Water organ is the kidney; its flavour is salty. The Horse should transform this Water to make it invigorating and fertile, invigorating himself at the same time. He must always strive to be dynamic and active: too much humidity and inaction will only paralyze him, if not physically at least morally, a state of affairs which the Horse will find difficult to endure."],
      "The Water Horse and others": ["Bizarre deaths often fall on his family and friends, but this Horse is endowed with rare power. Thus he can dominate his impulses, control his passions and master his excesses better than others. He may even be able to listen to other's advice. However, make no mistake, the Horse's temperament remains active, violent and inhabited by wild dreams. If he succeeds in channeling all this dynamism, he can become a great adventurer, in the noblest sense of the term, or a master in the art of governing, leading crowds and heading nations. The Water Horse can also be a humanist; he believes in the individual and will often plead his cause against the state, justice and society. It is not that the spiritual universe leaves him indifferent, but that he has a difficult time combining it with his need for action. And it is in this field that he can hope to obtain victory over his latent egotism."],
      "Some advice for a Water Horse": ["Allow your dynamism to drive you along; believe in yourself and in your lucky star; do not be afraid to take over the reins and lead. You possess the power to stir sleeping waters."],
      "The Year of the Water Horse (Fire Horse)": [
        "The culminating point in a Water Horse year will be winter, a period of gestation. The Yin of Water is brought to the boiling point by the Yang of the Horse, from which arises the Fire Horse.",
        "Seek equilibrium through a balance between action and reflection. Do not weaken your energies by impulsively throwing yourself into excessive physical or emotional adventures - reflect before becoming involved to avoid deceptions and failures. Do not allow yourself to be attracted to sleeping waters, but seek the invigorating source; you will succeed in doing many great things."

The Goat is invigorated by contact with this Element, which itself becomes spring-water, rain and running brooks. The Water Goat cavorts among the clouds and leaps about the fields, jumping streams to follow their winding courses. The Water Element can only be a symbol of fertility and a token of good health for Goats throughout their lives."

By keeping a watch on himself he will avoid excess and accept eventual trials calmly and serenely. In this way the Goat will be master of himself and able to gain a leading position, which he will turn into a game and a personal experience. He will also be at ease in a crowd, which will respond to him, since he will appeal to it not with violence but with restraint, perspective and humour.",

The Water Monkey perceives the world in a global and uncertain manner, through foggy and slightly confused vision. But the Monkey is both Yin and Yang, and it is in his power to enliven Water, to render it brancing and dynamic. Thus by his own power of will he can act upon this Element, inclining it towards the positive and the creative. So, Water Monkey, find your source, then flee the marsh."

      "The Water Monkey and others": ["The Water Monkey will be tolerant and thoughtful, capable of subduing his pride and of listening to others. He is inclined to moderation rather than excess, and will make his mark in a responsible position which he will assume calmly and serenely. However, this can be simply a game, another form of experience for the Monkey. He needs to test his potential and then the reactions of his friends. Yet he will almost never lose his sense of humour and detachment and will rarely take himself seriously. But boredom can sour his good humour and flights of fancy. The Monkey needs to communicate with men, to compel them to vibrate; he must lead them, if sometimes from a distance. The Water Monkey will be more of a humanist than a mystic. His deepest anxiety is the boredom of routine and its stagination."],

Sometimes those around him will be tempted to take advantage of his retreats into himself and his emotional imbalance and set out to exploit them. While the Water Dog will be perfectly aware of this, he will refuse to accept it, preferring to blame himself rather than question his relationships or his friends.

Attracted to oozing mud and slimy bogs, he should take care not to be sucked in; not to choose a dream over reality; not to cut himself off from the world and retreat into his illusory or mythical unverse.

He will be solitary and uncommunicative - unless he decides to become wealthy, in which case he will play the game and act the part of financier to perfection.
