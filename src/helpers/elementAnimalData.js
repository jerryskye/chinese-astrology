      "Characteristics of the Wood Rat": [
        "Wood is the coefficient for equilibrium for the Rat. Wood is of the morning, springtime, a temperate nature, a lover of harmony, beauty and elegance. As an Element of the Rat, who originates from the North and belongs to the winter solstice, Wood brings the mildness that characterizes its season and also its creative force. It is in the spring that nature is reborn, after germinating beneath the earth, symbol of the rodent. Wood, which stretches its branches towards the sky, towards harmony, while plunging its tentacular roots into the belly of Mother Earth, is by its nature, a factor of equilibrium for the Rat. But Wood is also a passionate Element, with a distressing habit of self-destruction. It is at once susceptible and excessive, but without losing its dignity. It will even supply 'Wood' for our Rat's saw-mill! For the latter does not hold back from his aggressive impulses, his outbursts of anger, interminable sulks and dangerous passions."
      ],
      Health: [
        "The organ of Wood is the liver; its flavour is acid. The Rat, over-anxious and given to fretfulness, ought to keep a particularly close eye on his liver and refrain from drinking too much."
      ],
      "The Wood Rat and others": [
        "The Rat is inclined to be carefree, and it is best that he adopt a relaxed style in all his encounters. Faced with a conventional situation, he must improvise and allow his imagination and his inventive and creative mind free rein. The Wood Rat could be a poet, a painter or even a farmer, thus uniting freedom and space, sky and earth and the wind, whose son he is."

      "Some advice for a Wood Rat": [
        "You are handsome and passionate, ready at times to transform the social structure. An advocate of liberty, perhaps? Politics, the stage, the arts await you. So leave your subterranean passages, leave your deep hole, and be carefree and relaxed."

      "The Year of the Wood Rat": [
        "The culminating point of a Wood Rat year will be springtime, the period of growth and prosperity. Leaving winter behind him, the Rat will move away from his Northern territory and travel East. His Yin aspect will tend towards the dynamism of the Yang. The Rat should profit from this season to brave new worlds and to create. Be supple in all senses of the term, know how to adapt yourself; this will be your winning card.",
        "Tendency of the year: A year for diplomacy and suppleness, favourable for international relations; a year also for expanding agricultural activities and for an increase in the family. But an egotistical attitude will bring about disasters and a pervasive climate of anarchy."

In this year of renewal you can apply novel techniques and new methods. Open your eyes and prick up your ears because fortune favours you.",

Wood brings a little gentleness to our Tiger, softening his aggresive nature and opening his pride to nuances. In the spring, the seed buried deep in the soil during the long winter blossoms, and nature is reborn. Wood symbolizes the breaking of dawn and this will incite the Tiger to leave his hiding place. Wood stretches its branches towards the heavens in the direction of harmony, but also plunges its roots deep into the earth. This double movement is a balancing factor for the Tiger. But Wood is equally the symbol of passion, violence and even destruction and self-destruction. The Wood Tiger is thus an ambivalent person. Beneath his peaceful exterior his spirit is stirred by excessive and explosive impulses. For this reason others will find his behaviour strange and often disconcertring."],

Alas, this is an illusion and a mask, behind which he skillfully hides a highly anxious nature. If he allows himself to be overcome by this anxiety he will head straight for failure.

The Tiger will become extremely dynamic due to the Yang force which he bears withing him; thus he will be more enterprising and more creative. Profit from this period to start some new enterprise or develop your artistic talents - Wood is by nature poetic. However, always retain your flexibility; in this way you will find it easy to adapt and gain a new lease on life. This is the period to do so because your opportunism will be remarkably well paid."],

He will rediscover the mildness of the fertile and creative mid-season, which will restore his equilibrium, release his inventive powers and reinforce his taste for the beautiful. He will be pushed out of his nest and discover the spectacle of dawn. This Element will develop in the Rabbit a sense of adventure, a passion for travel and a love of nature. But Wood is also a symbol of violence, even of destruction and self-destruction. Although he will not lose his dignity nor his reserve, the Wood Rabbit will be vulnerable to internal jolts and passionate love storms which will leave him giddy and bewildered. If your instinctive impulses are allowed to dominate you, they will blind you. Overcome your aggresiveness; do not allow yourself to be drowned by your emotions."],

He prefers to improvise and allow his imagination free rein, which encourages his creative spirit. The Wood Rabbit has poetic gifts and is attracted to the arts in general - unless he chooses horticulture or landscaping, which can please his sense of beauty and harmony while fulfilling his need for space and liberty."],
      "Some advice for a Wood Rabbit": ["You possess a good figure and are elegant, poetic and have an artistic soul. You do not appreciate restraints and obligations, so take responsibility for yourself and do not impose rigid restrictions on yourself or you will explode.

Aware of his weaknesses, such as his anxiety and self-questioning, he will respond to his predicament with a relaxed attitude, preferring his imagination to run free rather than be constricted by the rigid structures of a society in which he feels asphyxiated. This is a just and reasonable attitude especially suiting the Snake, who prefers the circle to the square and the curve to the angle. With deliberate improvisation, the Snake will extricate himself marvellously from the most difficult situations; he will glide and sneak in and out and let the storm pass; then, when it is all over, he will reappear, tranquil and calm.

        "It can be a beneficial time for the Rabbit who is often unselfconscious, detached and prudent, bringing him a sense of responsibility and an indication of the plan he should follow. Unfortunately, rigid plans do not suit his supple spine. Therefore the Rabbit should beware of excess and recognize that strength of purpose does not necessarily mean stiffness. Moreover, the Metal Element is attracted to mystical perspectives which, although not a summons to an authentic vocation, can become an alibi or a dangerous refuge for him. The Metal Rabbit seeks solitude, but sometimes has difficulty attaining harmony between his body and his soul."

He has a good feel for organizations, but at times may be slightly too blunt in his approach - plain-speaking will come more easily to him than tact and diplomacy. Maintain the moral and physical suppleness of the Rabbit; a stiff neck and a dry, cold heart are not in the nature of your symbolic animal. Rediscover agility, grace and patience. Be energetic, but do not forget that the excessive, in any form, turns against its author. File down your claws and become more supple; indulgence is not necessarily self-indulgence."],

You will often experience a loss of energy and dynamism, and suffer from depression and a lack of self-confidence.

        "The Water Rabbit knows how to listen. He is calm and reflective, and refrains from excess and dissipation. However, if he is to govern his life he must overcome a certain timidity and learn the art of indulging those passions he tends to recoil from, while at the same time controlling them. The Water Rabbit has a horror of difficulties and hates to make a fuss. He will be a good craftsman and a prudent businessman. A pacifist and humanist, he will be more concerned with social problems and the battle against injustice than with spiritual matters.",

He will then possess the art of governing justly and serenely, curbing all excessive passions. At ease in a crowd, he will know how to inspire and lead without violence or anger.

Water will not be an impediment to the Horse; his dynamism and Yang tendency will always drive him into the depths of himself and those universes which, for him, are synonyms of conquest.

Thus he can dominate his impulses, control his passions and master his excesses better than others. He may even be able to listen to other's advice. However, make no mistake, the Horse's temperament remains active, violent and inhabited by wild dreams. If he succeeds in channeling all this dynamism, he can become a great adventurer, in the noblest sense of the term, or a master in the art of governing, leading crowds and heading nations. The Water Horse can also be a humanist; he believes in the individual and will often plead his cause against the state, justice and society. It is not that the spiritual universe leaves him indifferent, but that he has a difficult time combining it with his need for action. And it is in this field that he can hope to obtain victory over his latent egotism."],
